Here is the transcription of the audio file.

So looking at the **Halpin and Mensforth Investments Limited** 2025 accounts. So when I look in the folder, I can see that there is no 2024 folder, and based on the engagement, I can see that ’25 is the first year. So there’s no ’24 returns to look at, and this is going to be the first year for the return.

So the first thing I’m looking for in the client information is to see if there are any notes about where the company’s come from, and if they’ve purchased a property during the year. So I can see that we have a **Landley Law** conveyancing reporting bundle document. And the letter details out the settlement information for the client. The part that I first want to look at is the page that says “Settlement Statement.”

So I’m going to go into the Xero workbook. So this workbook has the section for the Workings. The next tab is the Zero Amounts—so that would be the amount that’s showing in Xero—and then the Adjustment Required. And so the Workings is where we figure out the figure that needs to be showing in the final set of accounts. The Zero figure is the amount that’s showing in Xero; so for this client, they don’t have a Xero, so the figure in that column will be nil. And then the Adjustment is the difference between the Workings and Zero. So we would expect that the adjustment in this situation would always match the Workings.

So once we have the workbook opened, we’re going to start with filling out the Settlement Statement and Trust Statement pages from that settlement reporting bundle.

So first thing we want to add into the workbook is the property address, the date of the settlement. So from the settlement statement, I can see that it was on the **20th of December 2024**. So I’m going to note down that the purchase price was **$639,900**. There’s a deposit made of **$63,990**. Rates were paid on purchase of **$107.34**. And in the settlement statement, I can see that there is a **Rebate as Agreed** of **$15,000**. I’m just going to have a quick scroll through and see if I can find the agreement in there. Quite often we find that the rebates are not included in the settlement statement for what they are related to. But based on most rebates being the same from a developer to a purchaser, the rebate will be based on a Rates and Insurance or Body Corporate contribution. So we’ll note down the rebate that was received of $15,000. And then in the Workings, we’re going to add those figures together, and that’s going to give us the balance of **$561,017.34**.

This amount is the amount that was required to settle on the 20th of December 2024. We can then see a second page, which actually was the page before in this bundle, called the Statement. It can otherwise be called a Trust Statement. This shows the balance and how the balance was funded and any additional expenses paid for on settlement. So when we look at this one, we can first see that that deposit is mentioned again, so that’s the $63,990. And we can see that it was paid by the shareholder for the deposit, and then it was paid out to the vendor’s solicitor trust statement. Those two net off; they are the exact same amount and there is nothing further to do with either of those items.

So the next figure that I’m going to note down in my workbook is the balance... sorry, the balance I already have. The next figure is going to be the **Loan Advance ASB**. So that’s **$576,000**. I can then see that there is an amount required to settle, so that matches the first balance I have of $561,017.34. And then we have a legal fees breakdown of **$2,485.50**. We can also see that document if we scroll slightly further down to the purchase of 4/1 Matata Place tax invoice. And then we have a balance paid out of **$12,497.16**. So I’ve noted those figures down in my Workings. And then I have just done a quick sum at the bottom to double check that that equals zero. So I’m very happy with the settlement statement having all these details and it equals what I would expect for it to equal.

So those are the first document... is the first document I’ve processed in my Workings. So I have the property address, which is **4/1 Matata Place, Christchurch**. I have that the settlement was 20th of December 2024. And then I have details of the purchase price, what the lending is, what the legal fees are.

So with this one, with it being purchased in a look-through company, we need to keep the Workings set up for preparing a set of financial statements which will have both a Profit and Loss statement, an Equity statement, a Balance Sheet, and a Depreciation Schedule. And so with the Workings, what we want to make sure we’re doing is having a mention of all the details that will be required for filling out those financial statements.

So what we will then look to do as part of the preparation is both update the Profit and Loss workings with our workings from the source documents, but also be updating the Balance Sheet based on the figures that we can see during this process. So the first number that we can add to our Balance Sheet is the purchase of the property. So in the Investment Properties, we can link the investment properties figure at 2025 balance to the cell that has the purchase price. We’ll also note that down in the Capital section so: **4/1 Matata Place, Christchurch** with a value of **$639,900**.

Then if we have a look in the file at the other bits of information we have in here: We have some client notes mentioning that they have three loans for this property. One of them was structured incorrectly and it was in their personal name and not the LTC name. That is the loan that’s $64k—more or less matches that deposit. It is quite common for a look-through company or a company to have a deposit structure structured through the individual’s names rather than the entity. And that quite often happens with timing of when the deposit is drawn down and paid compared to when the actual settlement takes place. However, the client has said that it was an error, and it may have been an error, but we’re happy that that is related to the property.

Another thing they’ve mentioned in their second email that we have saved in the file is that they were only recently charged for the **LTC setup**, but that should have been charged at the time of setup. So we may look to accrue that one in as a fee for 2025 and leave it as a payable that gets paid during 2026. And then they’ve only recently had a Chattels Valuation done. So we’ll see if they’ve sent through those Chattels Valuations. If they haven’t, then we may be able to proceed without it.

So then into our **Halpin and Mensforth Financials**. So we have a document called “Managed by Williams” which is the **4/1 Matata Place End of Year Financial Statement**. So this is a Property Manager’s statement that has the address, it has the tenant’s name, the tenancy start date of **16 February 2025**, and the rent per week of **$540**. So if we have a look at that one, the income listed out is **$3,240**. The fees charged by the property manager are **$226.80** along with GST of **$34.02**. And there’s a net payment of **$2,979.18** for the period. So we can add those into the Property Manager’s Statements Workings in the workbook. And note down that the tenancy began on the 16th of February 2025. So that is two months after settlement, which was on the 20th of December 2024. So just a note that there was two months where the property hadn’t yet been tenanted.

The next piece of information we can see in the file for the attachments is a Rates Invoice. So we might come back to that one; it’s probably not the first thing that we will process. And then we have a **Cash Contribution Offer** document. So this is letting us know that on the 17th of December, ASB offered to Halpin and Mensforth Investments a **$5,150 cash contribution** for two term loan facilities, which was **91-001** and **91-002**, as long as they keep their loan for three years—36 months from the date it’s drawn down. So that’s a good-to-know piece of information. Yet we can see that the directors have signed that, so presumably they will receive it. If we don’t have anything else to tell us that they did or did not receive that, then we would proceed on the basis that it was received. But we will just park that one for a moment and have a look at what else we have in this file.

So we’ve got Body Corporate Invoice... again, we’ll come back to that one. We have a statement for the invoice **17569 from Lighthouse**. And this is from **Lighthouse Accounting** for **$983.25**. So based on the email that we read before about the setup fee only recently being charged to us, this is something we do want to note down. So in our **Accounting Fees Accrual**, we will add the setup fee of $983.25 so that we can expense this in the 2025 year and leave it as a payable for 2026. So I will use that invoice at the moment.

The next one that we have is an account statement for **Unit Lot 46**. So this appears to be the Body Corporate Levy... Annual Levy for 20th of December ’24 to 20 December ’25. Again, we’re just going to come back to this one in a little bit once we have had a look at the bank statement information. As we can see it’s been invoiced; we just want to know what the payments to it have been.

And then we have a **Velocity Invoice**. So this is from the 14th of November 2024. It’s for a full market valuation of **4/1 Matata Place Christchurch** for **$867**. So as we know, this is a new property purchased during the 2025 year, which was completed in December 2024. So I am going to note this invoice down in the **Due Diligence** section of the Workings, on the basis that this was done prior to the settlement and most likely was required for settlement to go through. So we will add this one in as an invoice in the Due Diligence section. If we later note that it was paid from the bank accounts, once we’ve had a chance to look at them, we may end up putting it into the bank statement workings and removing it as an invoice working to a bank statement and invoice working. But on first look, I would expect that this was paid from a personal account because it is prior to the settlement.

And in the file we also have a number of different loan and bank statements, but I can also see we have a folder called **ASB**. So I’m going to read through the ASB documents first before going into the other individual files that have been sent through.

So we have in here a set of statements that are for the company. So they’re going to be the ones that we will primarily be looking at. The ones that have the client’s personal name on them... while they may have some relevance to the company, we want to prioritize any information that’s provided to us that’s in the company name, and then secondarily look at the personal information that’s also provided. If the clients had mentioned in the emails that there were specific things in the personal bank statements, we would take a closer look initially. But they haven’t really mentioned anything in the personal statements apart from the 64k loan for the deposit. And so we will go back to look at that, but I just want to start by prioritizing these business bank statements first.

So the first statement is Statement Number 1, which starts on the 13th of December 2024. In the first transaction we can see is the **Cash Contribution of 5150**. So that’s perfect, that aligns with our expectation from that document from ASB. So the Cash Contribution is an income source when it’s related to a business or property. And it’s usually written as a percentage of the lending that’s being drawn down, being offered as a cash back to incentivize a client to use the particular bank as their lender. So this is going to be listed in the Workings as Cash Contribution 5150. And then we’re going to include that in the Profit and Loss workings of Bank Contribution 5150.

The next transactions we can see on the 20th of December is a **Transfer In of $12,497** and 16 cents. And that looks as though it might be coming from another ASB account, quite possibly one related to the shareholders. But that figure perfectly matches the balance paid out from the Settlement Statement. So we will start by treating that as the settlement funds that have been received, and adding that into our Bank Statement Workings.

The next transaction is 2nd of January: **Halpin CM for a dollar**. And that is going to be one of our shareholders with the last name Halpin, which matches the name of the company. A one dollar funds introduced. And then we go through the next set of expenses and income.

So we have two different loans here, one being the **91-001 loan** and **91-002**. And they both have a repayment on the 2nd of January. Both of them are interest. So we’ll detail down each of those interest payments separately into separate columns of **Loan 91-1 Interest** and **Loan 91-2 Interest**. And that allows us to separate it out so that we can make sure we know the interest on each of the loans.

We then have a Funds Introduced amount again... so we will use that to add to our Funds Introduced column in the Workings. And move on to the next statement for January.

So then we get to our next transaction. Again, this is a $200 transfer in, so we will include this as Funds Introduced. And then we have on the 16th of January four payments to the loans. So each loan has an interest and a principal payment. We want to separate out the interest and the principal payments because the interest payments are going to be tax deductible; the principal payments are not going to be tax deductible, they are going to reduce the balance of the loan. So we’ll separate those in the Bank Statement Workings, and we will separate out the 91-001 and the 91-002 principal workings in those Bank Statement Workings so that we can clearly see which of the two loans are being reduced by these payments so that we get the balances correct at the year end.

On the 20th of January, interestingly, we have **$2,260 received from Williams Corp for 4 Weeks Williams Rental**. The significance of that date is it’s received on the 20th of January. We noted down before that the tenancy began on the 16th of February 2025. So this $2,260 is almost a month before the tenancy beginning date, which is a little bit unusual. So we’re just going to make a note next to that: "Tenancy began 16 Feb 25" and just put next to that "Received Rental Income Prior." And we will add into our Bank Statement Workings a section that says "Williams Corp Rental Income," so we’ll just add 2260 as the amount received for that. So we can come back to that one later.

And then our next transaction is a bank transfer that says **64k Repay**. So this $177.54 transfer lines up with what our client said in their email about a 64k loan not being drawn down in the company name, being drawn down in a personal name. So for this one, we’ll start a new column and maybe we’ll just call it **Transfer to 64k** for now, and add in the 177.54. And we can look into that a little bit further later.

And then our next transaction is the 29th of January: we have $200 transferred in from the client, so we’ll add that into our Funds Intro.

We continue here with some more loan interest and loan principal payments. So again, we will keep those separate for each loan and detail those out in the Bank Statement Workings.

On the 4th of February, we have a Interest **Lighthouse M Reimbursement for $157**. So looking at this, and seeing that it says "Lighthouse Mort" [Mortgage], which will be Lighthouse Mortgages, we can see that this is an interest reimbursement towards the lending that was received. We don’t need to know the details of why. We will just add in a separate line to the Bank Statement Workings called **Interest Reimbursement** and add in this $157. So this will reduce our interest expense that we get to claim for this year. But we will come back to it and add it into the Profit and Loss Workings rather than taking it off of the interest charges for the 91 or the 92 loan, because we do just want to make sure that we are recording those loan interest payments correctly, and then we can deduct anything from the interest that’s required in the actual workings.

The next two are as expected. So we have PM transfer the 64k again, so we’ll put that into the Transfer to 64k column. We’ve got $200 of Funds Introduced on 12th of February, so we’ll add that in as well.

And then we have a payment on the 13th of February for **$890.38**. So this isn’t clearly labeled for what this is for. It’s got a bank account number, it’s got the word Halpin, there are a few numbers on this: 73211570, and then it says **4/1 Matata**. I think we’ll just add this into a new column for now and come back to it later. It looks like it will be related to the property somehow, but we might just need to go through those invoices that we looked at before again.

And then we’re at 13th of February. We have our Interest and our Principal payments again. So we’ll add those into the columns in our Bank Statement Workings.

On to our next bank statement. We have the 24th of March... a **Williams Corp Guarantee Monthly... Rental Top Up** for **$2,502.14**. So this one, similar to that other payment before, doesn’t have enough details for me to be certain of what the payment is for. So I will just add it into a new column so that I can go and look at those invoices again later. So I have it in the column to look into in the March amount. So if I can’t figure it out from the invoices, I have it noted as the month, so that I can go back to the client and clarify with them the specifics of what date... what month it was paid in and the amount.

On the 13th of March there, I then have my next two interest payments and my next two principal payments. We will move on to the 13th of March statement. So first one there is a $100 **Rental Guarantee** amount received. So add that into the not the Williams... not the normal Rental Income, but the other Rental Income that we set up. We’ve got our transfer out to the 64k transfer. $200 received from the Property Manager.

And then on the 27th of March, I have another two interest payments and another two loan principal payments. So we will note those down. And that appears to be the last transaction for the 2025 year, which ends on 31 March 2025.

So taking a look at that, what I can see is that our balance on the 27th of March closes out at **$12,452.98**. And so I’m going to add that $12,452.98 into my Balance Sheet Workings. So I’ve added here in the Balance Sheet Adjustments... so I’ve updated the Current Bank Account 1 to ASB 00 Account. And I will add that balance of $12,452.98 in. So that’s one of our first Balance Sheet adjustments. We already did the Investment Property; now we have a Bank Account balance. So we can see that our total assets at this stage are $652,352.98.

So I’ve gone through the Company Bank Statements first. So we have a pretty good understanding of what’s going on so far. So we have a Cash Contribution. We have two loans which have had interest and principal payments, so we’ve separated those out. Our shareholders have introduced some funds into the company. We can see that there has been Rental Income received. And we can also see that there has been Other Rental Income from Williams Corporation, which appears to be the guarantee. So I’m satisfied by those details to treat them as Rental Income and add them to the amount that I see in the Property Manager Statement, and that it’s not being double counted.

We had an Interest Reimbursement. So that was funds received into the company of interest. So when we do our Interest Workings, we’re going to reduce them by the amount that was received.

We had our Settlement Funds, which is just a capital transfer from the settlement into the bank account for the company.

We have our Unknown Payment 1, Unknown Payment 2. So the first one for $890.38, the second one for $1471.76. And then we have some transfers out to the 64k account. So I’m going to go back to my Client Information and see if I can fill in any of these blanks and get a little bit more information about what’s going on with some of these transfers that I’m not 100% sure of.

So when I go back into my first file that has all of the invoices, I’m going to start looking at the Halpin Mensforth Financials folder, because this had a few invoices that we saw at the beginning which I skipped over on purpose.

So the first one that I have seen, that I think I know the answer to now, is... if when I look at the fifth invoice down, which is **RINV 399831**... I can see that there is a number on there of **$1471.76**, which matches our Body... our Unknown Cost 1. So that says **Insurance Premium $1471.76**. The invoice was issued to Halpin and Mensforth Investments Limited for Matata Place. And if I go back to my Bank Statement for when the payment was made...

I can see a lot of these details match. So we have Lot 46, Matata, Tili [?] B12 to B13, which is also on the invoice. So I am satisfied that our payment for $1471.76 is for **Body Corporate**. It does appear to me that the client has missed the payment of the other parts of the annual levy. So this is not the whole invoice. The whole invoice is **$2196.87**. And they have only paid the Insurance Premium component of $1471.76. However, I’ll add that into the Workings that this is for Body Corporate. And I am not sure why they have not made the whole payment; they haven’t mentioned it in the emails that I just read before about not making payments. So we will just add this one in as the payment for the Body Corporate amount. So I’ve updated that transaction in my Bank Statement Workings to say Body Corporate now that I know what it’s for.

And we’ll have a look at our next invoices to see if there are any others that I can identify. So again, we have a statement for the Body Corporate which was on the 11th of March. So that must have been just before our client made payment of the Insurance component on the 12th of March. So we don’t have further information to say that they paid the rest. So we will leave that as is, $1471.76 as Body Corporate.

So it looks like the next statement is from the 27th of December. Yeah, so the last one closed on 27 December, with a balance of $62,432.11. And we have that on the 27th of December as the opening balance. So again, I can see a couple of funds introduced for $200 and then $150. And on the 23rd of January, I can see that there is a transfer of **$64,077.50**.

There is a **Debit Interest Charge** on the 2nd of January. So that looks like our first Interest Charge related to this deposit that has been paid to the solicitor for the purchase of the property. And on the 23rd of January, I can see that there are charges for January to date. But they were also refunded on the same day. So those two net one another out. So interestingly, it looks like we’ve just got the 2nd of January interest rate. But it does appear that on the 23rd of January, this has been transferred to a new account. So we just want to see if we can find which account this has been transferred to so that we can correctly make the interest adjustments as required.

Okay, so I can see that there is a **Streamline Account** that begins on the 22nd of January. I can’t see this transfer going into the account, but I can see that there are payments coming through that say **64k Repay of $177.54**. And so that does match up with what we had from our company bank accounts. So we do want to note that one down. Just make a little note that this is where the funds are being received into. And that keeps happening on the 22nd of February, the $177.54 being received. So this is looking pretty normal.

So it looks like we have a **Prime Housing**... 123035026012191002 loan of **$63,804.66**. And and when I have a look at the loan labeled **Matata 64k**, that also matches. So on the 23rd of January, they had the $63,900 drawdown. So it looks like what’s happened is the client’s have paid the deposit of $63,900 from a revolving credit or an overdraft facility. And then they have refinanced it into a loan in January. So we just have that one month of Overdraft Interest to record for this so far. So that’s going to be **$343.11**. And this is going to go into a separate Bank Statement Workings because these are personal bank statements. So we don’t want this recorded in the bank statements that are for the company, which we’ve already got the closing balance for. So I’m going to add in the interest for the overdraft under a **C Halpin Bank Statement Adjustments**. So let’s add in **C Halpin Bank Statement Adjustments**. And so we have Overdraft Account 00 I think it was. Yep, so the account ends in 00. So we’ll just add Overdraft 00. And we can add in our interest of $343.11 in January.

And then what we want to look at is that **Matata 64k loan**. So we have the $63,900 drawn down in January. And we’ve got five interest payments that relate to this year, and we can see five principal payments as well. And they match that $177.54 that our clients have been transferring from the company to their personal account. Because those principal payments are going to a loan that’s held in the shareholder’s name, we’re not going to add those into the Workings, because they are not relevant for our company. The interest payments, however, are; they are relevant that they are deductible for the property purchase because it’s related to the deposit. But the other side of that is that they are **Funds Introduced**. So we’re going to record them in the Bank Statement Workings for the personal bank account, and the adjustment for it will go through Funds Introduced rather than as part of a loan payment or as part of the bank statement balance change. So we’ll add those workings of... **72.92, 145.83, 145.76, 145.69 and 145.61** into Jan, Feb and March interest for Loan 91-2 interest for C Halpin.

And then looking at the section with the Matata accounts, we can also see that we have the **Matata Loan Statements**. So these two loan numbers do match what we had in our other bank accounts. But this gives us a really clear breakdown of the loan interest and the loan principal payments, so that we can make sure our closing balance is correct. So we did already note down all the interest and principal payments from the bank statements, but we didn’t actually note down our principal drawdown for the lending. So we don’t currently have a loan in our Balance Sheet Workings. So we’re going to go and update the Balance Sheet with the **Loan 91-1** and **ASB Loan 91-2**. And add in the fact that they are... they have a closing balance each on those statements. So two options here: we can copy in the closing balance at 31 March 25, or the closest date to it, so that was 27 March 25. So for the Loan 91-1, that is **$287,204.10**. The other option for this would be to add in the workings of **$288,000** minus the principal payments that were in our bank statements. Either option will work as long as the workings have been entered in correctly. And then we’ll do the next one. So we have Matata Loan 2. So that’s ASB Loan 91-2. So we’ll add that as an option for our Balance Sheet. And then we’ll add in that balance of **$287,157.39**.

While I’m here, I’ll also add in a liability for our **Vendor Rebate**. So our Vendor Rebate was for $15,000 from the Settlement Statement. This is a contribution typically towards expenses related to the property usually Rates and Body Corporate. So we add this rebate as a liability because until it’s used, it’s a liability for the company. It will get used every time we pay Rates or Body Corporate and will reduce it. So the clients won’t have Rates and Body Corporate on their Profit and Loss Workings because they got a rebate contribution towards it. So we’ll add that $15,000 in now. And then when we get to our Workings, this is when we will adjust it.

Something else we want to think about is our **Accounting Fee Accrual**. So that’s going to be typically just for the current year of accounts that are being prepared. So for this client, the fee is going to be **$1,600 plus GST**. So we’re going to add into our Accounting Fee Accrual $1600 plus GST, which is **$1840**.

So we already added in our Setup Fee before, which was $983.25. And now we’ve got $1840. So we’ve got a total Accounting Fee Accrual of **$2823.25**. So this will go into the Profit and Loss to the Accounting Fees, and we’ll also add it into the Balance Sheet as Creditors because this amount is still payable at 31 March 2025.

That’s our first Profit and Loss adjustment that we have: $2823.25 to Consulting and Accounting, and the Creditors on the Balance Sheet.

So then if we go to our Profit and Loss Adjustments. Let’s start at the top and work our way down. So the Rental Income is going to be our Property Manager Statements Workings, which was $3,240, and our Other Rental Income from Williams Corporation, which appears to be the Guarantee. So that added up to **$4,862.14**. So Rental Income of **$8,102.14**. We then go to our Bank Contribution which was **$5,150**. And we’ll add that in as income as well. So Total Income in the Workings is **$13,252.14**.

We don’t have any details of Dividends or Interest Income, so nothing to add on that one.

We then go to our Expenses. So Advertising: we didn’t have any details of advertising. Agent Fees: we did have Agent Fees from our Property Manager Statement, so we will add that in now: **$260.82**. We’ve already added in our Consulting and Accounting, so we will not add that again, that’s already there. Depreciation: our clients did mention that they have a Chattels Valuation, which would result in depreciation. That hasn’t been seen in the folder that we have. So we will leave that off for the moment, but maybe on a first review we might ask for it. We then get to Due Diligence. We’ve already added in that invoice of $867. There were no other invoices or payments that supported a Due Diligence claim.

No Entertainment. No Home Office. And then we get to Insurance. So we had insurance paid in March, but we determined that was Body Corporate, so we’ve moved that to Body Corporate. And we don’t have any other details of insurance payments. So we’ll leave that as nil. Interest - Mortgage: so for this one, we’re going to add in our loans that are held by the company, the interest paid on them. And we’re going to add in the interest that was paid on the deposit loan that is held by the individuals. And we also have an interest reimbursement that we need to reduce this by. So we’re going to add together the Loan 91-1 interest, the Loan 91-2 interest minus the interest reimbursement, and plus the Loan 91-2 interest for C Halpin and plus the Overdraft 00 interest for C Halpin. So that gives us **$9,772.29**.

Our next option here is Legal Expenses. So we did have legal fees paid on settlement. So we will add those in to our Profit and Loss Workings as well. Light Power Heating: nothing. Loss on Disposal: nothing. Office Expenses: nothing. Overdraft Interest: we’ve already included the personal overdraft interest for the deposit in the Interest Workings, so we will not claim it again. We then get to our Rates. So we paid some rates on settlement, so we had a rates adjustment of $107.34 on settlement. And then we had our rates payment from the bank statement of $890.38. So usually, we would add both of those into the Profit and Loss. In this case, we have the Vendor Rebate, which is going to be a contribution towards Rates and Insurance. So we’re going to minus both of those off of that Vendor Rebate as well. So the Vendor Rebate is now **$12,530.52**. And...

So now we have a completed Profit and Loss for this company. So it has full bank account... full bank statement workings. The property manager workings. The workings for the expenses that have run through the personal bank accounts. And then there is a profit and loss workings and balance sheet adjustments along with some notes to understand what has been done in this job.
